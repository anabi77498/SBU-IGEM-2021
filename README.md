# SBU IGEM 2021 TEAM PROJECT

Our project aims to develop a novel microcystin degradation solution by utilizing recombinant E. coli that heterologously over-express MlrA, 
or microcystinase, an enzyme known to degrade MC-LR in the native Sphingomonas sp. Two approaches have been developed to address this issue. 
One strain will express MlrA anchored to the outer membrane via a fusion protein with poly-Î³-glutamic (PgsA), and the other will freely secrete MlrA 
into the periplasm via a modified twin arginine translocase (Tat) secretion system. This project also proposes a microcystin detection method using a 
two-hybrid bacterial assay, which generates a fluorescence signal based on protein-protein interactions through the use of the messenger molecule cAMP.
